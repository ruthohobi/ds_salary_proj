The Sharecare platform provides each person - no matter where they are in their health journey - with a comprehensive and personalized health profile, where they can dynamically and easily connect to the information, evidence-based programs and health professionals they need to live their healthiest, happiest and most productive life. With award-winning and innovative frictionless technologies, scientifically validated clinical protocols and best-in-class coaching tools, Sharecare helps providers, employers and health plans effectively scale outcomes-based health and wellness solutions across their entire populations. We are always looking for people that value the opportunity to work hard, have fun on the job, and make a difference in the lives of others through their work every day!

WhiteHatAI is a division of Sharecare. WhiteHatAI is working with Special Investigations Units (SIU) for major U.S. payers who believe fraud alone in their organizations accounts for 10% of their total healthcare claims transaction volume. These units are currently recovering less than 2% of their fraud, leaving billions of dollars in losses.
The rules-based, retrospective, analytic systems currently used have proven insufficient in combating FWA. The market is missing the critical ingredient for fighting FWA prepayment; a flexible prepayment solution that moves investigative efforts from post payment to prepayment. This need creates a tremendous opportunity. The market is searching for the prepayment Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach provided by WhiteHatAI. The combination of the maturity of AI technologies and increasing FWA makes this the perfect time for WhiteHatAI.

WhiteHatAI Data Analytics team is looking for a Statistician/Data Scientist. In this role, you will engineer and implement production code to generate insights from data across the company and its customers. You'll engage in a variety of projects that will build your analytical skills across a wide spectrum of areas. As a Statistician/Data Scientist, you will help us build the next generation of data-driven decision-making tools for our distributed analytics applications.

The focus of this position is to research, engineer and develop software and methods to find fraud, waste and abuse in health insurance claims. You will use a combination of mathematics, statistics, statistical learning and software engineering to recover savings for health insurance industry members, providers and payers.

WhiteHatAI is a division of Sharecare. WhiteHatAI is working with Special Investigations Units (SIU) for major U.S. payers who believe fraud alone in their organizations accounts for 10% of their total healthcare claims transaction volume. These units are currently recovering less than 2% of their fraud, leaving billions of dollars in losses.
The rules-based, retrospective, analytic systems currently used have proven insufficient in combating FWA. The market is missing the critical ingredient for fighting FWA prepayment; a flexible prepayment solution that moves investigative efforts from post payment to prepayment. This need creates a tremendous opportunity. The market is searching for the prepayment Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach provided by WhiteHatAI. The combination of the maturity of AI technologies and increasing FWA makes this the perfect time for WhiteHatAI.

WhiteHatAI is a division of Sharecare.

These units are currently recovering less than 2% of their fraud, leaving billions of dollars in losses.
The rules-based, retrospective, analytic systems currently used have proven insufficient in combating FWA. The market is missing the critical ingredient for fighting FWA prepayment; a flexible prepayment solution that moves investigative efforts from post payment to prepayment. This need creates a tremendous opportunity. The market is searching for the prepayment Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach provided by WhiteHatAI.

We are always looking for people that value the opportunity to work hard, have fun on the job, and make a difference in the lives of others through their work every day!

WhiteHatAI is a division of Sharecare. WhiteHatAI is working with Special Investigations Units (SIU) for major U.S. payers who believe fraud alone in their organizations accounts for 10% of their total healthcare claims transaction volume. These units are currently recovering less than 2% of their fraud, leaving billions of dollars in losses.
The rules-based, retrospective, analytic systems currently used have proven insufficient in combating FWA. The market is missing the critical ingredient for fighting FWA prepayment; a flexible prepayment solution that moves investigative efforts from post payment to prepayment. This need creates a tremendous opportunity. The market is searching for the prepayment Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach provided by WhiteHatAI. The combination of the maturity of AI technologies and increasing FWA makes this the perfect time for WhiteHatAI.

Job Summary:
WhiteHatAI Data Analytics team is looking for a Statistician/Data Scientist. In this role, you will engineer and implement production code to generate insights from data across the company and its customers. You'll engage in a variety of projects that will build your analytical skills across a wide spectrum of areas. As a Statistician/Data Scientist, you will help us build the next generation of data-driven decision-making tools for our distributed analytics applications.

The focus of this position is to research, engineer and develop software and methods to find fraud, waste and abuse in health insurance claims. You will use a combination of mathematics, statistics, statistical learning and software engineering to recover savings for health insurance industry members, providers and payers.
Qualifications:
MS or PHD degree in statistics, bio-statistics, bioinformatics, computational biology, mathematics, operations research, or in a fundamentally quantitative field
5+ years' experience in data analytics, data science, quantitative analysis using statistical computer languages (R, Python, SLQ, etc.) to draw insights from large data sets

WhiteHatAI is a division of Sharecare. WhiteHatAI is working with Special Investigations Units (SIU) for major U.S. payers who believe fraud alone in their organizations accounts for 10% of their total healthcare claims transaction volume. These units are currently recovering less than 2% of their fraud, leaving billions of dollars in losses.
The rules-based, retrospective, analytic systems currently used have proven insufficient in combating FWA. The market is missing the critical ingredient for fighting FWA prepayment; a flexible prepayment solution that moves investigative efforts from post payment to prepayment. This need creates a tremendous opportunity. The market is searching for the prepayment Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach provided by WhiteHatAI. The combination of the maturity of AI technologies and increasing FWA makes this the perfect time for WhiteHatAI.

WhiteHatAI is a division of Sharecare.

These units are currently recovering less than 2% of their fraud, leaving billions of dollars in losses.
The rules-based, retrospective, analytic systems currently used have proven insufficient in combating FWA. The market is missing the critical ingredient for fighting FWA prepayment; a flexible prepayment solution that moves investigative efforts from post payment to prepayment. This need creates a tremendous opportunity. The market is searching for the prepayment Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach provided by WhiteHatAI.

We are always looking for people that value the opportunity to work hard, have fun on the job, and make a difference in the lives of others through their work every day!

WhiteHatAI is a division of Sharecare. WhiteHatAI is working with Special Investigations Units (SIU) for major U.S. payers who believe fraud alone in their organizations accounts for 10% of their total healthcare claims transaction volume. These units are currently recovering less than 2% of their fraud, leaving billions of dollars in losses.
The rules-based, retrospective, analytic systems currently used have proven insufficient in combating FWA. The market is missing the critical ingredient for fighting FWA prepayment; a flexible prepayment solution that moves investigative efforts from post payment to prepayment. This need creates a tremendous opportunity. The market is searching for the prepayment Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach provided by WhiteHatAI. The combination of the maturity of AI technologies and increasing FWA makes this the perfect time for WhiteHatAI.

Job Summary:
WhiteHatAI Data Analytics team is looking for a Statistician/Data Scientist. In this role, you will engineer and implement production code to generate insights from data across the company and its customers. You'll engage in a variety of projects that will build your analytical skills across a wide spectrum of areas. As a Statistician/Data Scientist, you will help us build the next generation of data-driven decision-making tools for our distributed analytics applications.

The focus of this position is to research, engineer and develop software and methods to find fraud, waste and abuse in health insurance claims. You will use a combination of mathematics, statistics, statistical learning and software engineering to recover savings for health insurance industry members, providers and payers.
Qualifications:
MS or PHD degree in statistics, bio-statistics, bioinformatics, computational biology, mathematics, operations research, or in a fundamentally quantitative field
5+ years' experience in data analytics, data science, quantitative analysis using statistical computer languages (R, Python, SLQ, etc.) to draw insights from large data sets

WhiteHatAI is a division of Sharecare. WhiteHatAI is working with Special Investigations Units (SIU) for major U.S. payers who believe fraud alone in their organizations accounts for 10% of their total healthcare claims transaction volume. These units are currently recovering less than 2% of their fraud, leaving billions of dollars in losses.
The rules-based, retrospective, analytic systems currently used have proven insufficient in combating FWA. The market is missing the critical ingredient for fighting FWA prepayment; a flexible prepayment solution that moves investigative efforts from post payment to prepayment. This need creates a tremendous opportunity. The market is searching for the prepayment Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach provided by WhiteHatAI. The combination of the maturity of AI technologies and increasing FWA makes this the perfect time for WhiteHatAI.
